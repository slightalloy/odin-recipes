    <h2>Description</h2>
    <P>A delicious and healthy fall comfort food. This dish is vegan and my meat-eating husband loved it!</P>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound Brussels sprouts</li>
        <li>Â½ (8 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons tahini paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons capers (Optional)</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add Brussels sprouts, cover, and steam until fork tender, about 10 minutes. Drain, reserving the hot water.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Mix in lemon juice; add tahini paste. Stir in reserved hot water until mixture is the consistency of sauce.</li>
        <li>Stir Brussels sprouts, spaghetti, and capers into the sauce. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
